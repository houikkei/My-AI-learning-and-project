Data Mining Process
Data mining is an iterative process that requires continuous adjustment and optimization of each step to achieve optimal results.
1. Problem Definition

Set Clear Objectives: First, define the specific goals of data mining, such as predicting customer churn, identifying fraudulent transactions, or recommending products.
Establish Evaluation Metrics: Select appropriate evaluation metrics based on objectives, such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, or AUC.

2. Data Collection

Identify Data Sources: Based on the problem definition, determine which data needs to be collected, such as internal databases, external APIs, or public datasets.
Data Cleansing: Address issues such as missing values, outliers, and duplicates to ensure data quality.

3. Data Exploration

Data Visualization: Utilize charts, graphs, and other visual tools to explore data distributions, trends, and relationships, employing tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to create histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
Feature Engineering: Transform, combine, and create new features from raw data to enhance model performance.

4. Model Building

Model Selection: Choose appropriate models based on problem type and data characteristics.
Model Training: Train the model using training data and optimize model parameters for best performance.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using test data and adjust based on evaluation results.

5. Model Deployment

Deployment: Deploy trained models to production environments, such as API encapsulation or application integration.
Monitoring: Monitor model performance and update/maintain as needed.

6. Result Interpretation

Model Result Explanation: Interpret model predictions and analyze prediction processes using methods such as LIME or SHAP.
Report Generation: Present data mining results in report format, utilizing charts and graphics to showcase analysis results.
